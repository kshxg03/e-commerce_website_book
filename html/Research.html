 				The first reference i took was from a website named Barnes and Nobles. The arrangement of the elements, divs, logo, search bar and navigation bar of the home page of this website caught my attention. It was simple and efficient, so I decided to design the home page of my website the same way. As we can see, the left picture is the screenshot of the referenced webpage and the right picture is the screenshot of the web page i designed.

 				The second reference that i took was from a website named Books Mandala. The product page of this website was very basic, simplistic and well organized. The products were were well presented with the cover of the book, the authors name and the price. So, I implented the same idea and arranged my prodcuts the same way with books cover, authors name and the price as well. The left one is the refernced weboage and the right one is the webpage i designed.

 				The third reference that i took was also from the same website named Books Mandala. In this refernce, i implented the idea of the div structure of the webpage. There was some space on either sides of the div in the webpage which looked clean for a blog. So, i implemented the idea of this webpage and set my div width to 70% and margin to auto which resulted creating space on either side of the div. The left picture is the screenshot of the referenced webpage and the right one is the screenshot of the webpage i designed.

 			<p>
 				The fourth reference that i took was from google accounts page. The form was in the middle of the webpage and the design was simple and aesthetic. So, i implemented the same idea to my contact page and kept the div content in the middle. The left picture is the screenshot of the referenced webpage and the right one is the screenshot of the webpage i designed.

 				The fifth reference that i took was also from the same website called Barnes and Nobles. In the home page of the website there was a banner with some space on either side of it. So, i referenced the idea and made similar banners for my webpage where i kept some space on either side of the banner as in the refernced webpage. The left picture is the screenshot of the referenced webpage and the right one is the screenshot of the webpage i designed.
