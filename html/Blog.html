 				It is always fascinating how the technology has rapidly evolved over the years since the year 2000.	"2000" because that was the year major development of technology started rapildy.In 2001, Steve Jobs announced and released worlds first ever iPods. In 2003, amdroid was introduced.

In 2007, Steve Jobs introduced iPhone to the world. In 2010, iPad was introduced. Instagram which is super popeular and one of the most used social media platform was also introduced in the year 2010. The technology has evolved vastly since 2000's and will still continue its evolving process. From 2G networks to now 5G networks. From push button phones with keypad to input values to now touchscreen smartphones with face recognition. And there are more to come in the near future with introduction to bitcoins, metaverse, microsoft holograms and so on. But with the development it also has both positive and negative impacts in our lives.

 				Development of technology has made our lives easier than before. Due to evolution of technology, there are many technologies developed to ease out our day-to-day life. Like, washing machines, dishwasher, these technologies technically does our work for us making our day-to-day life easier. As such there are many positive impacts of technology in different aspects. Many machinaries have been developed with the technology to assist human lives. Like in hospitals, ultrasound devices are used, equipments used in dental clinics are all developed through technology. Similarly, technology aids us to decide our vacations by looking up the weather forecasting. It helps us communicate with our friends and family overseas. Due to rapid development of technology, we can now shop online, book tickets online, chat online. With the development of computers and its softwares, storing records has been the easiest. With the development of camera's and DSLR's we can now capture important moments of our life and store it. We can learn what is happening around the world by just sitting in a couch. There are also many developments in bio-technology as well. Victims of accidents can now attach a prostethic legs or arms to replace the ones that they have lost in the accident. There are also apps that can track our calories, diet, total steps. Technology has also made payment easier. We can now pay for the groceries or stuffs that we have bought by just a swipe of QR code. With the development of GPS and google maps, adventures has been safer than ever. With development of google and many different search engines, getting answers to our questions has been the fastest. Development of technology has also made eductaion far more practical.

 			<p class="body_text"><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">Negative impacts of technology</span><br>
 				With the positive impacts of technology, there are many negative ones as well. Surely, the technology now has made communication really easy and efficient, but in order to communicate we need devices and the devices we use such as: Television, phones, tablets or laptops have blu-ray lightcoming from it which is really harmful for our eyes. So, the major negative impact of the current technology is complications such as eye strain, headache etc. Besides these, there are other physical effects as well like: lack of exercise or reduced physical activity which may cause obesity which then might be the cause of heart attack, stroke and so on. Sitting down for long period of time watching television or gaming can also cause poor posture, neck pain, back pain and so on. Using electronical devices before bedtime also cause disturbance in sleep due to the blue light. Technology also has negative impacts on psychological and social aspects of our life. Teens who play violent games tend to be psychologically more aggresive. The social media is full of photoshopped commercial images and people compare themselves with the images, which makes them insecure and less confident which might then result to depression and anxiety. With the avaibility of vast resources, there are also downsides of internet, one of which is access traumatizing videos of violence, murder, suicide, or accidents. Due to internet and technology, most teens nowadays are anti-social or isolated. They dont like communicating with new people or even their relatives, becuase they just enjoy their game. Eventhough, social media is introduced to bring people together, it might as well have an opposite effect. As, the users are bound withing four walls communicating with others in phones by typing which results in lack of social or verbal skills.

 				Thus, with the development of technology, it has brought us both positive and negative impacts in our daily life. Communication is super fast and efficient, news and events around the world are easily accesible. However, this is not the peak of technology yet. Technology is still in the process of evolution and will keep evolving with introduction to new tehcnologies like: Virtual Reality, Bicoins, Artificial Intelligence, Metaverse, Microsoft Hololens and so on.
